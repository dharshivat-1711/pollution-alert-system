- Checks pollution level against a safe threshold
- Displays clear SAFE or ALERT messages
- User-friendly and responsive web interface

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project folder
3. Double-click on `index.html`
4. Enter a pollution value and check the result

## Logic Used
- If pollution value is greater than the safe limit, an alert message is shown
- If pollution value is within the safe limit, a safe message is displayed

## Purpose
This project was developed as an academic exercise to understand basic web development concepts, conditional logic, and how technology can be used to solve real-world environmental problems.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time pollution data APIs
- Display of pollution history using charts
- Improved UI and mobile responsiveness
